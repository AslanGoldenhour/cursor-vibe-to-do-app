# Coding Standards

- Always use proper TypeScript types and interfaces.
- Comment complex logic thoroughly to explain "why" not just "what".
- Keep dependencies up-to-date to avoid security issues.
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations for consistent code formatting.
- Use modern React patterns including hooks and functional components.
- Group related components, utilities, or hooks into their own directories with clear naming conventions.
